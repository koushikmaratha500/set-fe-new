                        Skill Education are abilities for adaptive and positive behavior that enable humans to deal effectively with the demands and challenges of life.[1] This concept is also termed as psychosocial competency.[2] The subject varies greatly depending on social norms and community expectations but skills that function for well-being and aid individuals to develop into active and productive members of their communities are considered as life skills.
